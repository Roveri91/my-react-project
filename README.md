# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- The public folder is where all of the static assets related to your app will go. This could include images, icons, and information files for the browser.

- Inside the src folder is where you will find the code that runs your app. The main.jsx file here serves as the entry point of the application.

- Run with 'npm run dev'
